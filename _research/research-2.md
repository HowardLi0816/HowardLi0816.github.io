- Built SAL-ViT to boost PI efficiency (maintain accuracy & reduce latency) on ViTs with Pytorch.
- Developed learnable 2Quad (L2Q) as the approximation of Softmax, which introduces learnable scaling and shifting parameters to the prior 2Quad, and trained on Cifar and ImageNet with knowledge distillation.
- SAL-ViT can averagely achieve 1.60×, 1.56×, 1.12× lower PI latency with 1.79%, 1.41%, and 2.90% higher accuracy compared to the existing alternatives, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively.
- Authored(has been accepted) a paper in 2023 International Conference on Computer Vision(EI).
