- Developed dual fusion enhancement technique to mitigate data replication in diffusion models.
- Constructed robust metrics to evaluate the trade-off between caption generality and data replication.
- Reduced replication by 43.5% compared to the original model while maintaining the diversity and quality.
- Submitted a paper to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing(EI).
    - [Under Review Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07254)
