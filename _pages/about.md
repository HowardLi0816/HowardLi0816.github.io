Currently, I am an M.S. student (will graduate in Summer 2024) specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science at the [University of Southern Calfornia](https://www.usc.edu/)'s [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/). My academic journey began with a B.S. degree from the [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/en/) at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), setting the foundation for my passion in the AI domain.

My research interest spans multiple areas, including generative modeling, robotics, AI safety, probabilistic modeling and application of AI. At present, I am privileged to be working under the guidance of [Prof. Peter A. Beerel](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Beerel/Peter) with the [Energy Efficient Secure Sustainable Computing Group](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/). My primary research focus is on developing novel methods to prevent data memorization and replication in diffusion models to mitigate risks associated with training data leakage.

Previously, from 2019 to 2022, I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate researcher under the mentorship of [Prof. Hao Yu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=yuh3&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1). This experience introduced me to the rigors of academic research, honing my analytical skills and driving me to pursue further study in this field.

In the near future, I can't wait to pursue my Ph.D. and contribute towards safer, more reliable, and more efficient AI systems that can solve complex real-world problems.
